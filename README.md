# pico-socket

Server and Client library for adding Online Multiplayer to Pico-8

This Project borrows heavily (but simplifies) the logic in
Ethan Jurman's Pico Tiny Tanks - https://github.com/ethanjurman/pico-tiny-tanks

## How to use?

For this, you'll need Node JS, and Pico-8.

To start, make a new folder, and run the following in that new folder:

```
npm init --yes
npm i pico-socket
```

Export your game for the web (e.g. `export game.html`) and put your new game
files in the folder you just made (specifically your `.html` and `.js` export).

Create a `server.js` and call the `createPicoSocketServer`
(see the example in `sample/server.js` in this project). You'll need to pass in
the following information when you call the `createPicoSocketServer` function:

- `assetFilesPath` - where you game assets live (you can use `.` if they are in the same folder)
- `htmlGameFilePath` - the name of your html export
- `clientConfig` - an object with the following values:
  - `roomIdIndex` - the GPIO address index which dictates which other clients you should connect to
  - `playerIdIndex` - the GPIO address index which dictates which player this client is
  - `playerDataIndicies` - a list of indicies per-player, which dictates which GPIO addresses that player is responsible for.

## What is it?

pico-socket is a library that allows multiple Pico-8 web clients (HTML export)
to talk to each other via websockets. The communication between clients is done
using Pico-8's GPIO addresses.

## Simple Example

In your Pico-8 game, use GPIO addresses as a substitute for game state, using
`PEEK` and `POKE` to access data for the different players.

```lua
room_id_addr = 0x5f80 -- index 0
player_id_addr = 0x5f81 -- index 1
player_0_y_addr = 0x5f82 -- index 2
player_1_y_addr = 0x5f83 -- index 3

function _init()
  poke(room_id_addr, 0) -- hard code to 0
  poke(player_id_addr, 0) -- start as player 0
  poke(player_0_y_addr, 64)
  poke(player_1_y_addr, 64)
end

function _update()
  player_addr = 0
  if (peek(player_id_addr) == 1) player_addr = player_0_y_addr
  if (peek(player_id_addr) == 2) player_addr = player_1_y_addr

  -- move up and down
  cur_y = peek(player_addr)
  if (btn(‚¨ÜÔ∏è)) poke(player_addr, cur_y-1)
  if (btn(‚¨áÔ∏è)) poke(player_addr, cur_y+1)

  -- swap player id
  if (btnp(‚ùé)) poke(player_id_addr, 0)
  if (btnp(üÖæÔ∏è)) poke(player_id_addr, 1)
end

function _draw()
  cls()
  rect(40, peek(player_0_y_addr), 44, peek(player_0_y_addr)+4, 12)
  rect(88, peek(player_1_y_addr), 92, peek(player_1_y_addr)+4, 8)
end
```

Create a `server.js` file next to your `.html` and `.js` export,
configured in the following way:

```js
const { createPicoSocketServer } = require("pico-socket");

createPicoSocketServer({
  assetFilesPath: ".",
  htmlGameFilePath: "./sample.html",

  clientConfig: {
    roomIdIndex: 0, // ROOM_ID

    // index to determine the player id
    playerIdIndex: 1, // PLAYER_ID

    // indicies that contain player specific data
    playerDataIndicies: [
      [2], // PLAYER_0_Y
      [3], // PLAYER_1_Y
    ],
  },
});
```

If you run the `server.js` using `node server.js`, you can navigate
to `localhost:5000` in two separate windows. If you press ‚ùé in one,
and üÖæÔ∏è in the other, you'll see that each window controls a separate
box.
